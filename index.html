						<strong>What is pre-registration and how does it improve peer review?</strong>
						Benchmarks on popular datasets have played a key role in the considerable measurable progress that machine learning has made in the last few years.
						But reviewers can be tempted to prioritize incremental improvements in benchmarks to the detriment of other scientific criteria, destroying many good ideas in their infancy.
						Authors can also feel obligated to make orthogonal improvements in order to “beat the state-of-the-art”, making the main contribution hard to assess.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pre-registration changes the incentives by <i>reviewing and accepting a paper before experiments are conducted</i>.
						The emphasis of peer-review will be on whether the experiment plan can adequately prove or disprove one (or more) hypotheses.
						Some results will be negative, and this is welcomed.
						This way, good ideas that do not work will get published, instead of filed away and wastefully replicated many times by different groups.
						Finally, the clear separation between hypothesizing and confirmation (absent in the current review model) will raise the statistical significance of the results.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are inviting submissions on the broad range of topics covered at <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/SubjectAreas">NeurIPS</a>! The <a href="author-kit/neurips2020_preregistration_template.zip">paper template</a> is structured like a <a href="author-kit/tutorial.pdf">mini-tutorial</a> on the pre-registration process to get you started quickly.
						Pre-registered papers will be published at the workshop. Authors will then have the opportunity to submit the results paper to the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/">PMLR</a>), a sister publication to the Journal of Machine Learning Research (<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/">JMLR</a>). The review process for this second stage will aim to ensure that the authors have performed a good-faith attempt to complete the experiments described in their proposal paper.

					<h2>Important info and dates</h2>
				</header>
				<div>
					<p>The review cycle for a pre-registered study consists of two stages: the <strong>proposal paper</strong> and the <strong>results paper</strong>.
					These stages reflect the exploratory (hypothesis generation) and confirmatory (hypothesis testing) phases of research.</p>

					<h3>Proposal paper</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Read our <a href="author-kit/neurips2020_preregistration_template.zip"><strong>mini-tutorial/template</strong></a> (<a href="author-kit/tutorial.pdf">PDF</a>) &mdash; it serves as a paper template, describes the submission process and the intended spirit of a pre-registration.</li>
						<li><strong>Submit</strong> your paper anonymously to <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NeurIPSWorkshopPrereg2020">CMT</a>.
							Differently from traditional submissions, the experimental section must only contain a description of experiments and protocol, and what conclusions can be drawn in different cases, without the results themselves.
                                                        The pre-registration proposal should use the <a href="author-kit/neurips2020_preregistration_template.zip">paper template</a>.
							We recommend <strong>4 pages</strong>, but we allow up to 5 pages (excluding references) for the pre-registration proposal. Note that, for some venues, only papers up to 4 pages (without references) are not considered as 'prior submission', see e.g. <a href="http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/submission/main-conference/author-guidelines">CVPR</a>. For others, e.g. <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/NeurIPS-FAQ">NeurIPS</a>, non-archival workshops like ours do not count as dual submissions. <strong>The deadline for submissions is <strong style="color:red">October 7th (midnight Anywhere on Earth: GMT + 12).</strong></strong>
						<li>Besides quality and potential impact of the idea, reviewers will also assess: (1) Are the experiments appropriate for validating the core hypothesis of the work?
						(2) Is the experimental protocol description sufficient to allow reproduction of the experiments?
						You will then have a <strong>rebuttal period (until October 27th)</strong> to address the comments of the reviewers, by writing (up to) a single page response.
						<li><strong>Decisions will be sent to authors by October 30th</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>On the day of the workop (December 11th or 12th, <strong style="color:red">remote</strong>)</strong>, authors will present their proposals and (optionally) their preliminary results.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Results paper</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>Authors carry out the experimental protocols proposed in their accepted proposal papers.
					<li>The results will be presented in second document known as the results paper.
<!--						<strong>The results paper consists of just the &ldquo;experimental results&rdquo; and &ldquo;conclusions&rdquo; sections of standard publications</strong>.-->
					This will be appended to the proposal paper to form the complete document.
					The deadline for the results paper is going to be in April, 2021 (tentative).</li>
					<li>We will then support and encourage the final results to be published at the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/">PMLR</a> in combination with the pre-registered paper in April 2021 (tentative).</li>
					<li>In case of interest, we will also organise a second virtual meeting at the end of April 2021 to discuss the experimental results and the lesssons learned.</li>

					<h2>FAQs</h2>
				</header>
				<ul class="spacious">
					<li><strong>Don't we need a positive publication bias? After all, there many more ideas that don't work than ones that do. Why is it useful to allow negative results?</strong><br>
						There are several benefits to publishing negative results.  If an idea is well-motivated and intuitively appealing, it may be needlessly repeated by multiple groups who replicate the negative outcome, but do not have a venue for sharing this knowledge with the community (see the CVPR 2017 workshop on <a href="http://negative.vision/">negative results</a> for a more detailed discussion of the benefits of publishing negative outcomes).
					</li>
					<li><strong>Doesn't prior work on existing benchmarks weaken my confirmatory experiments?</strong><br>
						Yes.  Each prior result reported on a dataset leaks information that reduces its statistical utility (we are strongly in favour of limited-evaluation benchmarks for this reason).  Unfortunately, from a pragmatic perspective, it is infeasible to expect every computer vision researcher to collect a new dataset for each hypothesis they wish to evaluate, so we must strike a reasonable balance here.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Is it OK to make changes to the preregistered experimental protocol?</strong><br>
						Although you should endeavour to follow the proposed experimental protocol as closely as possible, you may find that it is necessary to make small changes or refinements.  These changes should be carefully documented when reporting the experimental results: it is important to make clear which protocols have been modified after observing the evidence.
					</li>
					<li><strong>What prevents authors from secretly running experiments, and submitting a proposal omitting them?</strong><br>
						We cannot fully prevent unethical practices, but this is a risky strategy. The reviewers assume that no experiments were ran yet, so they can request significant changes to the protocol. This means that there is a significant chance those results cannot be used.
					</li>
					<li><strong>How does exploratory data analysis fit into this model?</strong><br>
						Exploratory analysis can come in multiple forms including:
						(1) Small scale experiments (typically on toy data);
						(2) Results listed in prior work.
						Both should be reported in the proposal paper as part of the justification for your idea. Neither should be considered by the reader of your paper as providing <em>confirmatory evidence</em> in support of your hypothesis (the goal of preregistration is to make this distinction explicit). By contrast, the confirmatory experimental protocol which you propose should seek to rigorously evaluate your hypothesis and must be performed on different data to your own exploratory experiments. However, for practical reasons, it may use datasets that have also been previously used in the literature (further discussion below).
					</li>
					<li><strong>What's the rationale for changing the review model?</strong><br>
						&ldquo;Preregistration separates hypothesis-generating  (exploratory) from hypothesis-testing (confirmatory) research. Both are important. But the same data cannot be used to generate and test a hypothesis, which can happen unintentionally and reduces the credibility of your results. Addressing this problem through planning improves the quality and transparency of your research, helping others who may wish to build on it.&rdquo; (source: <a href="https://cos.io/prereg/">cos.io</a>)
					</li>
					<li><strong>I have read the tutorial. Can you point me to a concrete example of a ML paper written with this spirit in mind?</strong><br>
						<a href="https://preregister.vision/papers/an_empirical_study_of_the_relation_between_network_architecture_and_complexity.pdf"><i>An empirical study of the relation between network architecture and complexity</i></a>, by Emir Konuk & Kevin Smith, won the best paper award at the pilot we run at ICCV 2019.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Where is the link to the pilot workshop you did at ICCV 2019?</strong><br>
						The previous edition of the workshop can be found <a href="https://preregister.vision">here</a>.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Where can I found more information about preregistration?</strong><br>
						There are a number of good resources for further reading around the ideas related to preregistration, including, but not limited to:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2600">The preregistration revolution</a></li>
